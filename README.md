# New York City Airbnb Listing Price Prediction

### A project by David Shimshoni

In this project, I aim exploring ways to predict listing prices on the [New York City Airbnb Open Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data). I am using approaches that I know and also discover, especially from Alexey Grigorev's [Machine Learning Bookcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code)
